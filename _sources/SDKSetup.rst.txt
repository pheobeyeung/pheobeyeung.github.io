SDK Set Up
==========

The URCap SDK is now deployed through a `Visual Studio Dev Container <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers>`__, so that you are able to get updated 
artifacts as they are released. This also reduces potential incompatability issues with different operating systems. This section will walk you through the VSCode configuration.
